# Asp.Net Core API Project: JWT-Based Authentication and Authorization

This repository demonstrates how to build a **token-based authentication and authorization system** in Asp.Net Core API projects using **JSON Web Token (JWT)**. 

- Build an Asp.Net Core API project with a **layered architecture**.
- Secure APIs using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
- Implement Access Token and Refresh Token functionality.
- Role-Based, Claim-Based, and Policy-Based Authorization.
- Integrate authentication and authorization with a membership system.
- Apply CORS configurations and error management techniques.
